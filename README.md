## MOO Lisp

> My [Own|Outstanding|Odd|Overrated|Offbeat|Obnoxious|Otherworldly]{2,} Lisp

Moo is a simple Lisp implemented in Python.
It is in no way intended to be used for anything serious. Ever.

### Usage

To run the repl

    ./moo

To interpret a file

    ./moo example.moo

### Run the tests

The test suite require `nosetests` to be installed. If you want to run the tests yourself, install dependencies like this:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### License

The REPL cow is blatantly ripped from [cowsay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay), which is [GPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
